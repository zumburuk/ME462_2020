Finish moving eyes
Modify ustepper robot to carry a camera
Modify it so that the base can rotate 360
Camera should be mounted through a standart mechanical interface
Robot should be able to follow people and integrate the eyes with the detected person
Robot should be able to scan an object place in a designated 25x25x25 volume and form a 3D representation of it
No cables should be hanging around
