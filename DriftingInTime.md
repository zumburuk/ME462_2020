## This document elaborates on how to move on under given conditions

### First of all
I just hope that **you and your beloved ones are all in good health**.

### What was planned?  
We have decided at the beginning of the semester that we would add _character_ to out lab, which was a well deserved suit for our lab.  We started with all the good intensions and contribution from all of you were nothing remarkable. I did enjoy every bit of it so far during the meetings.
Yet, then very much expected yet underestimated (_I am referring to my personal short sightedness here_) COVID-19 hit us the way it just hit.  
And now, we have to replan everything...

### So what is next:
- I expect to strictly observe a voluntary curfew. Hence, I do not plan to meet you folks in person, and I do not want you folks to meet in person to work on the projects.
- I do not want you to access the lab and hence, I will disable electronic entrance to the lab next week. Therefore, if you have any personal items in the lab, please do **get them before wednesday** (i.e. $25^{th} of March$).
- I am working on a new format for the rest of the semester so that we can continue working together (in groups) without having to physically come together.
- On the week of $23^{rd}-29{th}$ please do go over the [webots simulator](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial) and make sure that you understand how it works. You can also start grasping the basic concepts by visiting [robot benchmark web site](https://robotbenchmark.net).
- I plan to have a group meeting and announce date and time hopefully in a couple of days.  

_more to come soon_
