## This document elaborates on how to move on under given conditions

### First of all
I just hope that you and your beloved ones are all in good health.

### What was planned?  
We have decided at the beginning of the semester that we would add _character_ to out lab, which was a well deserved suit for our lab.  We started with all the good intensions and contribution from all of you were nothing remarkable. I did enjoy every bit of it so far during the meetings.
Yet, then very much expected yet underestimated (_I am referring to my personal short sightedness here_) COVID-19 hit us the way it just hit.  
And now, we have to replan everything...

### So what:
- I expect to strictly observe a voluntary curfew. Hence, I do not plan to meet you folks in person, and I do not want you folks to meet in person to work on the projects.
- I do not want you to access the lab and hence, I will disable electronic entrance to the lab next week. Therefore, if you have any personal items in the lab, please do **get them before wednesday** (i.e. $25^{th} of March$).
- I am working on a new format for the rest
