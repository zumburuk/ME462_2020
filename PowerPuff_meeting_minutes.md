Robot gripper awesome...
Hatem is to determine the simulator
Denge's eye is getting better

## 23 May 2020
Hatem continues to webots and to transform other designs to webots  
Denge moved on in the design of the eye  
Okan is almost complete, moved stuff to onShape, end effector interface and base motor belt connection will be studied

## 13 May 2020
Eye is much better, getting ready for print
Arm is partiallay printed for testing
Webots is improving

## 6 May 2020
Eye should improve... much more
Arm is almost there
Simulation on a representative arm is in progress

## 29 April 2020
Robot arm involves as required
World should be even more simplified

## 25 April 2020
Revised eye mechanism is shown
World is to be composed of colored spheres, cubes with customizable faces, and two robots
Robot arm should have two servos on the rotary base and base rotation servos should be on the fixed base

## 22 April 2020
Location of servos is to be decided


## 15 April 2020
webots is preferred for simuation environment
more to look at next time
eye-gripper scenarios are discussed

### Mechanical Design Issues:  

Modular architecure: 3D robotic arm with motors at the base, 
modules directly can be connected to the base, and connection is both mechanical and electrical

There should be at least two modules:
- one a simple character that can display limited amount of mimics/emotions
- one simple gripper like attachment

At least one of the modules should have a camera mounted on it

Test of the physical system on 3D printed parts should be done only to prove that the system works.
Then the system that is tested in a CAD environment will be ported to a simulation environment 
where you can reach it via python and program it

In this simulation environment, you will provide use cases where a student should practice control of the robot
in conjunction with image processing.

### For next week
Choice of CAD and simulation environment is expected.
