webots is preferred for simuation environment
more to look at next time
eye-gripper scenarios are discussed

### Mechanical Design Issues:  

Modular architecure: 3D robotic arm with motors at the base, 
modules directly can be connected to the base, and connection is both mechanical and electrical

There should be at least two modules:
- one a simple character that can display limited amount of mimics/emotions
- one simple gripper like attachment

At least one of the modules should have a camera mounted on it

Test of the physical system on 3D printed parts should be done only to prove that the system works.
Then the system that is tested in a CAD environment will be ported to a simulation environment 
where you can reach it via python and program it

In this simulation environment, you will provide use cases where a student should practice control of the robot
in conjunction with image processing.

### For next week
Choice of CAD and simulation environment is expected.
